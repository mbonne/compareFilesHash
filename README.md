# compareFilesHash

A simple interactive shell script.
I wanted to make a shell script which could replace the clumsy method of generating the hash,
then manually verifying it next to the hash distributed with app or file.

Not only is this tedious, human error is probable.

What it does:
takes some user input, File path and Hash string
Shows a menu to select the type of hash needing to verify.
Compares the two, returns good or bad message to let you know.

Needles to say, you must exercise caution when trusting the hash that is displayed on the website of the file you've downloaded... :tinfoil hat:

Disclaimer
This is by no means a be-all-end-all solution to trusted file verification. It is meant to be used as
another way to check integrity of files.


Any suggestions for improvements welcome.
